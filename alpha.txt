There can be conflict serializable schedules that cannot be
obtained if two-phase locking is used.

â€¢ However, in the absence of extra information (e.g., ordering
of access to data), two-phase locking is needed for conflict
serializability in the following sense:

Given a transaction Ti
 that does not follow two-phase
locking, we can find a transaction Tj
 that uses two-phase
locking, and a schedule for Ti
 and Tj
 that is not conflict
serializable.
